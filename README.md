# Google-Cyber-Security-Portfolio

Here you will find all of the projects for my Cyber Security Portfolio that I have done whilst completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

In this course I gained foundational knowledge that will prepare me for entry-level jobs in cybersecurity and help me understand how security teams protect their organizations and its customers.

This course covered many conceptual topics such as:

<li>Risk management</li>
<li>Threat analysis</li>
<li>Network security</li>
<li>Incident response</li>

<br>

It taught me new technical skills through:

<br>

<li>Network protocol analyzers (Wireshark and tcpdump)</li>
<li>SIEM Tools (Chronicle and Splunk)</li>
<li>IDS/IPS Tools</li>
<li>Firewalls</li>

<br>

And I was able to brush up on a lot of fundamental information and develop even further in the following skills:

<br>

<li>Python</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Linux</li>

<br>

Each directory holds the files for each of the courses in the certificate and the order they were completed in is:

***The focus of this Portfolio was to gather, improve and complete activies related to Cyber Security.*** <br>
***Self related activies such as professional statements, CVs, etc., will be included at a later date in a separate repo.***
